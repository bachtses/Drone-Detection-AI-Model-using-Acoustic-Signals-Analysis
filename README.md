# Drone-Detection-on-Acoustic-Spectrograms

This project processes video and acoustic data for drone detection using machine learning models. The `gfai_unimodal.py` script captures and processes video streams, detecting drones with a pre-trained model. The `fusion.py` script synchronizes logs from GFAI and Respeaker systems, performing data fusion to improve detection accuracy. The `flight_optimizer.py` script generates and optimizes waypoint paths for drone navigation, providing visual outputs and API endpoints for mission data processing.
