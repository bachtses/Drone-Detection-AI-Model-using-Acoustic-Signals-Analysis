The AI model trained is a lightweight 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for real-time drone detection on edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5.

1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on real-world audio samples for binary classification (drone / no drone)
AI Model: Trained with MFCC features, 3Ã—Conv1D layers, >95% accuracy on validation
Real-world field tested with over 6500 labeled audio samples
Achieved F1 Score: 91.2%, Precision: 94.2%, Recall: 88.5%, and Accuracy: 90.2% during field deployment
Tested with DJI Mavic 3 drone under varying distances, angles, and environmental noise

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of real-world acoustic recordings captured during drone flights and ambient background activity.
